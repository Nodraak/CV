        \nodItemMission{\textit{
            The ASTRIS kickstage is a 5 tons spacecraft developed by Ariane Group to be flown on Ariane 6 to provide additional capabilities and flexibility to payloads.
            In collaboration with Ariane Group, \textbf{PTS designed the full avionics of ASTRIS} up to PDR.
            The PTS developed avionics covered the \textbf{electronics of the OBC}, telemetry, power, data acquisition and valve and pyro control subsystems, as well the \textbf{low level software of the OBC, and complete software of the other subsystems}.
        }}
        \nodItemMission{Within the software team, I contributed to the following topics:}
        \nodItemMission{\textbf{Architecture and design}: requirements flow down, functional architecture decomposition, design of the CANopen-based internal bus.}
        \nodItemMission{\textbf{Documentation} (following ECSS standard): unit and validation test plans, software design document (SDD) and interface control document (ICD) ; With a focus on the Datapool, Telemetry pipeline and IOs drivers (UART, CAN, SPI).}
        \nodItemMission{\textbf{Implementation and integration}: ARM uc BSPs (Zynq 7020, SmartFusion2), RTOS (RTEMS), NASA cFS, drivers (UART, CAN, SPI). Version control and CI (Git and GitLab), maintaining three execution targets for different levels of tests (x86/Linux, ARM/QEMU, ARM/Zynq), code coverage (GCOV), static analysis (Cppcheck, SonarQube, MISRA), UTs (VectorCast).}
